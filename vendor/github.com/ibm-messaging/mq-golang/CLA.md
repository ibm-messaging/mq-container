IBM Contributor License Agreement
=================================

Version 1.0.0   January 14, 2014

In order for You (as defined below) to make intellectual property Contributions (as defined below) now or in the future to IBM GitHub repositories,
You must agree to this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

Please read this CLA carefully before accepting its terms. By accepting the CLA, You are agreeing to be bound by its terms.
If You submit a Pull Request against an IBM repository on GitHub You must include in the Pull Request a statement of Your acceptance of this CLA.

As used in this CLA:
(i) "You" (or "Your") shall mean the entity that is making this Agreement with IBM;
(ii)"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is submitted by You to IBM for inclusion in,
or documentation of, any of the IBM GitHub repositories;
(iii)  "Submit" (or "Submitted")  means any form of communication sent to IBM (e.g. the content You post in a GitHub Issue or submit as part of a GitHub Pull Request).

This agreement applies to all Contributions You Submit. 

This CLA, and the license(s) associated with the particular IBM GitHub repositories You are contributing to, provides a license to Your Contributions to IBM and downstream consumers,
but You still own Your Contributions, and except for the licenses provided for in this CLA, You reserve all right, title and interest in Your Contributions.

IBM requires that each Contribution You Submit now or in the future comply with the following four commitments.

1) You will only Submit Contributions where You have authored 100% of the content.
2) You will only Submit Contributions to which You have the necessary rights. This means that if You are employed You have received the necessary permissions from Your employer to make the
Contributions.
3) Whatever content You Contribute will be provided under the license(s) associated with the particular IBM GitHub repository You are contributing to.
4) You understand and agree that IBM GitHub repositories and Your contributions are public, and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information You submit with it)
is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the license(s) involved.
You will promptly notify the Eclipse Foundation if You become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make these commitments inaccurate in any way.
To do so, please create an Issue in the appropriate GitHub repository.
